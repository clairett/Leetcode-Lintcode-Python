## Tree 
- (94) Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
- (95) Unique Binary Search Trees II  
    Binary tree inorder traversal with the time complexity of O(4^n), this is because the problem meets the Segner's recurrent relation:
    C_0 = 1 and C_(n+1) is the sum of C_i*C_(n-i) where i is in the range of 0 to n.

If there are two nodes left, both of them can work as root for minimum tree height.
